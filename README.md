# Causal Analysis of Airline Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of an Airline Dataset to understand the factors influencing booking completion rates. The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, and Causal Discovery techniques to identify potential causal relationships.

## Project Structure

- **EDA and Data Visualization**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution, trends, and patterns within the data. This step involves summarizing statistics and creating visualizations to gain insights.
- **Causal Discovery Using Lingam**: Leveraging the Lingam (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) algorithm to uncover potential causal relationships within the data.
- **Custom DAG Creation**: Based on domain knowledge, a custom Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) was created to hypothesize causal relationships.
- **Treatment Identification and Analysis**: Identifying a specific treatment to analyze its impact on booking completion rates. The goal is to determine if interventions can lead to improved booking completions.
